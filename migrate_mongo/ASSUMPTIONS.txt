Assumptions
------------
1. Content fields which contain no data in all documents are assumed that they will not have data in all documents.
   So those fields (data) are not migrated.
2. As there is uid field in the document but no information for users, so users are created for those uids with dummy data.
3. Taxonomy terms are assumed that if they are already existed in the system, then will not created.
4. All fields which contains array values (multiple) values in same document, are migrated as taxonomy terms.
5. Terms created from migration MigrateMongoTerms contains multiple values for single document and because migrate module
   supports only one to one mapping for each row, these terms are created on fly and will not be removed if migration is
   rollbacked.
